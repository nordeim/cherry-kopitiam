Awesome job on your meticulous review, analysis and planning. Please keep up the good work. Now, please meticulously plan and then create the remediation plan to close the gaps identified in your meticulous code review. The goal is to make the codebase production-ready. Review and validate the remediation plan against the actual codebase again to ensure correctness and also to ensure that the architectural integrity is maintained for the application.
