Awesome job on your meticulous review, analysis and planning. Please keep up the good work. Now, please meticulously review the codebase files to align your understanding of the current state of the project and the actual implemention. Then meticulously create a briefing document for an AI coding agent to be able to continue from the present state. After conducting your meticulous codebase review to align your understanding of the codebase, you will create a comprehensive *single-source-of-truth* briefing document for any coding agent or human developer to have the same deep understanding of the project and the current codebase status. Save the agent *briefing document* that captures your aligned and validated understanding as a markdown file `CLAUDE.md`.

Create a **comprehensive briefing document** (CLAUDE.md) that serves as the master reference for any AI coding agent (or developer) working on this project.

## 📋 What's Included

The document captures:

✅ **Executive Summary** - Current state (70% implemented), metrics
✅ **Complete Architecture** - Frontend, backend, infrastructure breakdown
✅ **Database Schema** - All 10+ tables with precise field definitions
✅ **API Specification** - 6 endpoints with request/response patterns
✅ **Critical Issues** - 5 must-fix problems (Locations model, schema mismatches, API integration gaps)
✅ **Implementation Roadmap** - Detailed next steps for 4-12 week delivery
✅ **Code Patterns** - GST calculation, pessimistic locking, PDPA consent tracking
✅ **Quick Reference** - File paths, commands, key files to read first

## 🎯 Key Findings

This project is **well-structured but incomplete**:
- Backend is 95% scaffolded (migrations written, not executed)
- Frontend is 90% scaffolded (components ready, API integration missing)
- Infrastructure is 100% ready (Docker fully configured)
- Database design is solid (10,650+ LOC of carefully planned code)

The document is designed to be **immediately actionable** for the next developer or AI agent who picks this up. It prioritizes clarity, completeness, and clarity of what's done vs. what remains.
